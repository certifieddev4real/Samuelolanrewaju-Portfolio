Greetings Earthling, 
(or whatever the inhabitants of your  tiny planet is called),
i can see that you've traversed many galaxies and milkyways 
just to see this mind-blowing phenomenon for yourself.
However, it is with a heart heavy filled with a much more 
papable anticipation than yours that i say This project is 
still materializing across spacetime. Check back soon 
for its cosmic debut!
In the meantime grab a telescope, read the intergalactic 
charts, rejuvenate your spaceship and grap some asteroid 
cube refreshment or burning star tea

Greetings, Earthling (or whatever the inhabitants of your tiny planet are called),

I see you've traversed many galaxies and Milky Ways just to witness this mind-blowing phenomenon for yourself. However, 
with a heart filled with anticipation even more palpable than yours, I must inform you that this project is still materializing across spacetime. Check back soon for its cosmic debut!

In the meantime, grab a telescope, study the intergalactic charts, rejuvenate your spaceship, and indulge in some asteroid cube refreshments or burning star tea.

With love,
Certified Intergalactic Starcom Fleet Commander
